### How does it work?

- [Signup]({{ url_for('register') }}) all it takes is an email, no cash, no dash and no trash
- [Login]({{ url_for('login')}}), and
- Create your first [offer]({{ url_for('new_proposal_form') }}), and
- Accept or decline bids as they happen.

Checkout the existing [offers]({{ url_for('proposals')}}).

All offers and bids are **public**, so everyone can bid along.

#### How do I pay?

bid'n'buy is a facilitator, we **do not** handle financial transactions. If your bid gets accepted or you accept a bid, then both parties will be informed - via email - and its up to both parties to handle the financials.

We at bid'n'buy are a mature lot and we hope the same of our customers.

#### Can I pay in currency X instead of dollars?

The dollar is a symbolic currency on bid'n'buy, take it as you will. Most people consider it to be the US-Dollar and desire to have the equivalent amount in their local currency.

We at bid'n'buy are a mature lot and we hope the same of our customers.

#### What happened to the cents?

Our developer Elves decided that cents would make no sense and we discarded them.

If you want cents, write that into your offer: "*amount consider to be in cents not dollars, divide by 100 to get dollars*".

<hr width="20%">
#### I want to enter an amount!

Sorry, developer Elves again. Only percentage steps are possible. Bids can only be increased by one-percent, five-percent or ten-percent.

No one asks twitter for more than 280 characters in a tweet. Some things just don't happen. Although someone did ask twitter for more than 140 characters, so some things do change.

Major feature upgrade will be the twenty-five percent button but we are stilling working out the color of that button.

<hr width="20%">
#### Why are all offers and bids public?

Because it is more fun that way. More fun with the assumption that we are all adults here or at least have a certain amount of maturity.

bid'n'buy does prefer maturity over adultness.

<hr width="20%">
#### Why can't I bid on my own offer?

Would be kinda unfair, right! Instead you can accept or decline the highest bid on your offer, thats far more fun!

Unlike other auction platforms, bidding here is a two way, instantaneous activity. The bidder is informed if their bid was declined by the seller.

<hr width="20%">
#### Is there a time limit on offers?

No. There is no time limit on auctions, they remain active as long as the offers have not been accepted. Declining an bid **does not** conclude the auction.

<hr width="20%">
#### Is Maturity and Respect required?

Yes.

Be mature and respectful on bid'n'buy. Our customer service has been set high levels of user banning. Meaning we ban first and **do not** ask questions later.

<hr width="20%">
#### What is "Good Faith Technology"?

This is Good Faith Technology, that is, we don't handle:

- financials between seller and buyer
- returns of broken/wrong/defect/... goods
- broken promises of sellers or bidders
- misunderstanding between said two parties
- ...

We act in good faith that everyone behaves respectfully to one another and with one another.

#### Whats with the "I'm buying" on the Place page?

The [Place page]({{ url_for('new_proposal_form') }}) has a toggle to indicate that someone is **not** selling something but rather they are *buying* something.

To sell something is the basic intention of the bid'n'buy but sometimes you want to buy something off someone. Be it that stranger on the street with that great bag or the influencer on social media who has a great outfit on.

Normally sellers make buyers but here on bid'n'buy, a buyer can make a seller! bid'n'buy is not only the first minimal viable bidding (MVB) platform but also the worlds first bi-directional bidding platform.

The *I'm buying* feature is unique in providing a mechanism for making sellers out of ordinary consumers. Driven by the financial might of those with financial might, everything and everyone is now truly a product!

*I'm buying* is not intended to be used to buy general items, it is targeted for a specific seller. Someone has something that you want and you are willing to pay them for it. That's it.

<hr width="20%">
#### Desire, Offer, Proposal .. what is the difference?

In the beginning, someone gave us the auction. The classic auction is: I have something to sell and put it up for auction to get multiple offers (aka bids) for my item. That is an *offer*: I have something to sell and I offer it up to the highest bidder.

I become a *bidder* when I bid on an item I desire and that I want to own. These are all things that sellers *assume* I wish to purchase. But what about items the seller has that I desire but they are not selling?

These are *desires* that I can create when I [place]({{ url_for('new_proposal_form') }}) something up for auction. Instead of creating an auction for something I own, I create an auction for something I *desire*. I can bid on my desires, just as everyone else can. The seller can accept or decline bids at any time.

A *proposal* is when someone wants something from *me*, a proposal is a desire that someone has for something that I have. Proposals I can only accept or decline but I cannot bid on them.

Everything is an auction, and everything has its price.
