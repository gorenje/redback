simple and easy to create auctions for anything.

Whether you want to sell or you want to buy, bid'n'buy offers something
for everyone.  All that is required is an email.

### How does it work?

- [Signup]({{ url_for('register') }}) all it takes is an email, no cash, no dash and no trash
- [Login]({{ url_for('login')}}), and
- Create your first [offer]({{ url_for('new_proposal_form') }}), and
- Accept or decline bids as they happen.

All offers and bids are **public**, so everyone can bid along.
